# template-hardhat

This is a set of contracts that will interact together for a minting and staking experience that rewards users with a token based on how long they stake their nft's for. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Install the dependencies using your prefered package manager
` npm / yarn install `

3. Run the tests on a network of your choice
` npm / yarn hardhat test --network <network>`

4. Deploy the contracts to the network of your choice.
` npm / yarn hardhat deploy --network <network>`

### These contracts may need changes depending on use and network deployment, especially to the hardhat configuation files and deployment scripts.
